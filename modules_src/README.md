libcopengl module internal shared library builder
=================================================

A very limited but fast opengl wrapper for python. Wraps parts of the fixed-function pipeline.


Implementation idea:

    Use a part of glew.h (here named opengl_preprocess.h) to generate most of
    the cython opengl wrapper functions, but override some of the
    autogenerated wrappers with functions from handmadewrappers.pyx.

    Automatic generation doesn't work for functions that have pointers in
    parameters or return values.

    glew:

        The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library

Installing:

    There is no "python setup.py install" support as this is only one piece of the copengl module.


Building:

    python generate_pyx.py (ignore the warnings)
    python setup.py build

    result:

        build/lib*/copengl.so

        copy the so/dll file to the correct directory (linux, macosx, windows, ..)
        under ../copengl.


    Sorry, the macosx version is RIDICULOUSLY large at 1.1MB. WTH is cython doing? Yes, there
    are 32bit ant 64bit versions embedded, but it should be an order of magnitude smaller, not
    only two times smaller. Using the cython predecessor pyrex resulted in a ~380kB file.
